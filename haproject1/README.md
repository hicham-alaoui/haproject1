haproject1
----------
This app uses python as the main coding program, plus HTML, CSS, and Java to display the singlelanding page


### Dependancies:

The CDN links in the original file(fresh_tomatoes.py) are used in addition to two new folders styles.ccs and scripts.js for CSS styling and Java script functions.


### Using the app files

Use the media.py file to create the main class for a similar project and to change or add the class variables
Use the tiles.py file to map details to variables and add the required imports and functions, etc.
The tiles_page file has all the necessary code to generate the index.html fle for you and fire your project to a local server.
